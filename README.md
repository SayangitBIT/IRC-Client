# IRC-Client

### Introduction:
Hi all, this is a basic IRC client made for Windows Platform. It allows one to
connect to any IRC server out there and interact with it. 

I would like to thank John Crickett for his amazing website

### Steps to launch the client:
- Compile SampleApp.cpp with the linker flags -lwsock32 and -lwininet 
- Compile WindowsPipeClient.cpp with the same linker flags.
- Run the SampleApp exe first followed by WindowsPipeClient exe.
- Wait for IRC server to connect. It will send welcome messages on successful connection.
